Just Cause 2 will load content in this order, content loaded later will override
any content with the same hash loaded earlier. Files in directories are loaded
in order of their filename, so content in alpha.arc will be overriden by
beta.arc.

Every .arc has a .tab associated with it, which is an index of the content of
the .arc.

archives_win32\*.arc
dropzone\*              (JC2 will take all files in this directory and create
                         dropzone\seperate_files.arc from them)
dlc\*.arc

Note that DLC packages are only loaded if the game detects you actually own that
content.

DLC .arcs are also special in that the game looks for certain files in them to
pick up new content.
